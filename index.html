								<h3>Personal Info</h3>
								<hr />
								<p>My name is Pedro Henriques. I‚Äôm a <em><b>Data Analytics Engineer</b></em>. 
								   I‚Äôm a Portuguese Data Guy that is currently living in <em>Switzerland</em>. At the moment I‚Äôm looking for a job here, as Data Analyst or Data Engineer.</p>								
								<p>
									Always eager to improve myself and learn new and cool stuff, either work related or just general knowledge.

									Since I was 5 years old I have been practicing team sports, which has always led me to be a very active person, who likes to be in contact with other people, with nature, and to practice a lot of sports. 
									Now being in Switzerland there will be no shortage of new adventures to experience.
									You can see more information about my sport life in the <a href="activities.html">activities</a>.
								</p>
								<p>
									Data is a passion that I have (as you can see üòÅ), learning with it and exploring every aspect of it, it's what I like to do, and what gives me pleasure. So I try to evolve constantly on the area, trying new aproaches and tools. 
								</p>
								<p>
									I try to keep my life balanced, between work, family and activities, that balance is very important to me, it allows me to grow and enjoy in all aspects of life.

								<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedro-sa-martins/"><h4>Pedro S√° Martins - Head of Data Engineering</h4></a>
								<a href="https://www.outsystems.com/"><p>OutSystems</p></a>
								<blockquote>I've managed Pedro during his work as a senior data engineer at OutSystems, where he quickly took over different initiatives and, despite being with us for just a month, started delivering value in a very autonomous way.
										Pedro doesn't shy away from reaching out to stakeholders and present a solution that not only answers their needs, but is able to scale in the future. He will challenge you at doing a better job and we loved having him on the team. 
										I'd recommend Pedro for any work related with data or software development, but especially for the work he did with us: data warehousing and data modeling with direct contact with the stakeholders. 
										His knowledge of the Azure Data Platform (including Power BI), Pentaho and analytical databases like Snowflake is definitely a great toolkit to showcase that technology is not a barrier for him.
